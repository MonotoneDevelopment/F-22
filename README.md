# FGUK_F-22_Remix
A "remixed" and updated version of the FGUK F-22 aircraft for FlightGear.
Created out of necessity due to the legal troubles surrounding another repo.

Due to the legal troubles surrounding Pheonix's F-22, I created this repository to deal with that problem.

This is licensed under GPL-v3.

========== ALL AIRCRAFT CREDIT GOES TO ========== 

The original maintainers of the F-22 on FGUK. I did not create the models, textures,
fdm, scripts, or any other part of the original project. I will be specifying which 
files I have created in this readme, as well as which ones I have edited.
